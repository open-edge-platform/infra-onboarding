# CVE-2020-8559 has been fixed on the kube-api side: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/92914.
# k8s.io/apimachinery still follows redirects, hence the CVE is not yet fixed there, see:
# - https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/93129
# - https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/1906
# We should be safe to ignore CVE-2020-8559 as long as we use kube-api server that doesn't respond with redirects.
