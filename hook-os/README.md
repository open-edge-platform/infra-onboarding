## Overview

Hook is the Tinkerbell Installation Environment for bare-metal. It runs in-memory, installs operating system,
and handles deprovisioning. It is based on [LinuxKit](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit).

This repo is forked from the open source repo [github.com/tinkerbell/hook](https://github.com/tinkerbell/hook).
Summary of all the changes and contributions can be found [here](CHANGELOG.md)

Following components have been added to the open source HookOS for our specific purpose

- Device Discovery: This service can read all the hardware data (serial number, UUID etc) and send out to the Edge Orchestrator
while provisioning.
- Fluent Bit: This service helps us stream the logs of all important services to the Observability microservice
of the Edge Orchestrator.
- Caddy: This service is used as a proxy to communicate with the Edge Orchestrator securely.

## Features

- Lightweight OS: Size is less than 300MB.
- Easy to customise: Services can be embedded within the OS using individual container images and can be configured
in a simple YAML file. Files can be embedded similarly.
- Device Discovery: This service can read all the hardware data (serial number, UUID etc) and send out to the Edge Orchestrator
for provisioning.

## Get Started

Instructions on how to build HookOS on your machine.

### Develop the HookOS

There are several convenient `make` targets to support developer activities. You can use `help` to see a list of makefile
targets. The following is a list of makefile targets that support developer activities:

- `lint` to run a list of linting targets
- `build` to build the compressed HookOS image in `tar.gz` format

#### Build Component

```bash
make <COMPONENT NAME>
```

Components can be `device_discovery`, `fluent-bit` or `hook_dind`

Example

```bash
make device_discovery
```

#### Build container images of all the components to be embedded

```bash
make components
```

#### Configure Edge Node and Edge Orchestrator parameters

```bash
make configure
```

All the configurable parameter details can be found in [config.template](config.template)

#### Create placeholder for Edge Orchestrator SSL Certificates

```bash
make certs
```

#### Build HookOS kernel container image

**NOTE**: This target will build kernel container image even if another image with identical tag is available locally
or in the Production Release service.

```bash
make kernel
```

The container image tag is determined by

1. Linux kernel version: For this project we currently support only `Linux 5.10`.
Its a Long-Term Support (LTS) kernel which is deemed to receive security updates and bug fixes until end of 2026.
2. Linux kernel point release: Extensive provisioning tests across various platforms have been
successfully conducted using Kernel Point Release `228`, which is the current default point release.
This can be modified by updating `HOOK_KERNEL_POINT_RELEASE` inside [Makefile](Makefile).
3. `SHA256` hash of combined contents of [Dockerfile](hook-os/hook/kernel/Dockerfile) and
[kernel parameters](hook-os/hook/kernel/configs/generic-5.10.y-x86_64):
Any change to these files will lead to a different kernel tag.

Example of a kernel tag: `5.10.228-95e4df98`

**NOTE: It has been observed that building the kernel with identical parameters**
**and environment variables results in a different container image SHA ID in every run.**

#### Builds HookOS binaries

**NOTE**:This target fails if the kernel container image is not available locally or in the Production Release service.
So either run `make kernel` before executing this target or run `make build` to combine both.

```bash
make binaries
```

The output can be found in the `out/` directory.

#### Builds the complete HookOS artifact

```bash
make build
```

The output can be found in the `out/` directory.

This process compiles all components, creates placeholders for certificates,
builds the kernel (if necessary), generates the binaries, and packages everything into a `.tar.gz` archive file.

The kernel image is built fresh locally only if the expected image tag is not available locally
or in the Production Release service.

#### Publish HookOS kernel as a container image to Production Release Service

**NOTE**:This target is intended exclusively for use within the CI/CD pipeline.

```bash
make push-kernel-ci
```

This pushes the HookOS kernel image to the Release Service only if the image tag
(not to be confused by image SHA ID) isn't already present in the Release Service.

#### Publish HookOS as a OCI artifact to Production Release Service

**NOTE**:This target is intended exclusively for use within the CI/CD pipeline.

```bash
make publish-binaries-ci
```

#### Publish both HookOS kernel container image and HookOS OCI artifact

**NOTE**:This target is intended exclusively for use within the CI/CD pipeline.

```bash
make artifact-publish
```

#### Lint for License, ShellCheck, and Markdown

```bash
make lint
```
