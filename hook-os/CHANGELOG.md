# Summary of Changes to Upstream Open Source Project

This document summarizes the changes made to the upstream open source project [Tinkerbell Hook](https://github.com/tinkerbell/hook).
All the changes have been made on top of version `v0.10.0`.

## Overview

Forked repo is stored in the `hook/` folder.
Changes have been made to enhance and customize the functionality for our specific use case.

## Changes

### Major Modifications

1. **files/dhcp.sh**
    - During startup, a one-shot DHCP call is executed on the interface that matches the `worker_id` (MAC Address)
provided in the kernel arguments, instead of running DHCP on all `eth*` interfaces.
    - This ensures that the IP address assignment is reliably completed before the `device-discovery` stage.

2. **images/hook-bootkit/main.go**
    - Added feature to measure and relay telemetry data on the time taken by the bootkit stage for KPI measurement.
    - Implemented `RestartPolicy` for tink-worker to ensure it restarts if the caddy endpoint is not yet available.

3. **images/hook-bootkit/go.mod**
    - Updated `github.com/docker/docker` module to address [CVE-2024-41110](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2024-41110)

4. **images/hook-bootkit/go.sum**
    - Updated `github.com/docker/docker` module to address [CVE-2024-41110](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2024-41110)

5. **images/hook-docker/Dockerfile**
   - Replaced `docker:26.1.0-dind` base image with custom `hook_dind` image.
   - This change addresses the security vulnerability related to port `2376` by keeping the port closed.

6. **images/hook-docker/main.go**
   - Replaced syslog port `514` with `5140`.
   - Added syslog format configuration `rfc3164`.
   - This change enables streaming data to fluent-bit.
   - Added 3 second delay post detecting reboot trigger file to provide sufficient time for tink-worker to send workflow
     execution success to tink controller

7. **images/hook-mdev/Dockerfile**
   - Added a non-root user.

8. **kernel/configs/generic-6.6.y-x86_64**
   - Set flags to enable XZ Compression.

9. **kernel/configs/generic-5.10.y-x86_64**
   - Set flags to enable DM Verity.
